Formatting

Should find one concept of arrange the code for the whole project, for Android studio, already have it.

- Code formatting is first order of business (វាជាការងារយើង ចឹងត្រូវមានទំនួសខុសត្រូវ ពេលយើងសរសេកូដ
    យើងសរសេសំរាប់អ្នកដទៃអានដែរ មិនមែនតែខ្លួនឯងទេ)-> don't think "get it work" is first order of your business
- Code is a communication between other professional developer
